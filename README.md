### What I do 🤔
<hr>

- I am the youngest Member of Technical Staff at Microsoft AI's core product team.
- I led the Receipt Recognition project at Instacart that detects discrepancies across 80%+ of orders, driving millions in savings per month. I gained an exception from leadership to ignore all years of experience requirements for a promotion within my first 6 months.
